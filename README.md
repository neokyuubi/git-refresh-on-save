# Git Refresh on Save

Automatically refreshes Git status whenever a file is saved. This is particularly useful when working with remote/SSH sessions where Git status updates might be delayed.

## Features

- Automatically runs `git.refresh` command on file save
- **Smart Git repository detection** - only runs in actual Git repositories
- Updates the Source Control panel status immediately after saving
- Works seamlessly with both local and remote repositories
- **Graceful handling** of non-Git directories - no errors or unnecessary operations

## Installation

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac)
3. Search for "Git Refresh on Save"
4. Click Install

## Usage

The extension works automatically after installation. When you save a file:

- **In a Git repository**: Automatically refreshes the Git status
- **Outside a Git repository**: Does nothing (no errors or unnecessary operations)

The extension intelligently detects whether you're working in a Git repository before attempting to refresh Git status, ensuring optimal performance and user experience.

## Requirements

- VS Code version 1.75.0 or higher
- Git installed on your system (for Git repositories)

## Extension Settings

This extension currently doesn't provide any configurable settings.
